# find-n-run
GNU awk fork of the original find-n-run utility for puppy linux.

Puppy linux forum users SFR and L18L have developed Find-N-Run, a wonderful
little application starter that displays your `*.desktop` files in a
`gtkdialog` window with a progressive typing search field to narrow down the
list. It's all written in shell, optionally augmented with a ROX-Filer
application directory.

For now the version of Find-N-Run in this repo is SFR's original version 1.9,
as included in Fatdog64-700, a 64-bit OS in the Puppy linux family.
I have yet to start modifying SFR's version to use GNU awk.
